            //Stretch Tasks

            //Right now this program is designed for one user. Giving the ability to enter a user name when the program begins would make the program useful for multiple users. At this point do not worry about trying to add passwords.That is outside of the scope of what we know at this point.Letting the users log in with only their names is less secure, but we're focused on functionality right now.

            //Hints

            //Persistence is not required. Meaning each time you run the program all of the values can reset.

            //You can choose any starting balance to begin the program.

            //Think about what data type should be used for dealing with money.
